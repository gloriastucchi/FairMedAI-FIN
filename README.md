# FairMedAI-FIN 🏥 
## Benchmarking, Evaluating, and Extending Fair Identity Normalization in Medical Imaging

## 📌 Overview  
Ensuring fairness in AI-driven medical diagnostics is critical for equitable healthcare outcomes. This study explores the **Feature Importance Normalization (FIN)** methodology across diverse **medical imaging datasets** to evaluate its impact on bias mitigation. Specifically, we aim to determine whether FIN effectively reduces disparities in feature importance across sensitive attribute groupings, promoting fairness in AI models.

To assess this, we will apply FIN to **CheXpert** and **NIH Chest X-rays** datasets and benchmark its effectiveness using established fairness metrics, including:  

- **Equal Opportunity (EO)**  
- **Demographic Parity Difference (DPD)**  
- **Equalized Odds (Eq Odds)**  
- **Equality-Scaled Area Under Curve (ES-AUC)**  

Additionally, we will explore **new fairness metrics** or propose fairness-aware loss functions tailored for medical imaging applications.

## 🎯 Objectives  
✅ **Replicate & extend** Fair Identity Normalization (FIN) to CheXpert and NIH Chest X-rays datasets.  
✅ **Evaluate** existing fairness metrics in medical imaging.  
✅ **Analyze** when and where current fairness metrics succeed or fail.  
✅ **Develop** a novel fairness metric or loss function for medical AI.
